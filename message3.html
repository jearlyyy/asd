            baby i know we talked about this, but i just want to say it again. baby adjustments in a relationship are completely normal. 
            it’s not about being strict or trying to control each other, it’s about respecting each other’s feelings.
             we’re partners, and that means your feelings matter just as much as mine. 
             we’re partners here, okay? i also want us to always feel comfortable being honest with each other, 
             especially when something doesn’t feel right. let’s not hold back or keep things to ourselves. 
             since we are in a long distance relationship openness and honesty matter even more, and i want us to keep working on that together.
