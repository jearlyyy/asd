it’s been four months since we started talking, it started with a lazy conversation, simple messages,  slow replies, and nothing too serious. i never imagined that something so simple would grow into something this meaningful. but day by day, we got closer, started opening up, and became a big part of each other’s lives. you became someone i truly care about.

these four months weren’t always easy. we’ve been through some tough times, moments of confusion, misunderstandings, and emotions that weren’t easy to handle. but through it all, we didn’t walk away. we chose to stay, to talk things through, and to keep trying.

that means so much to me. it shows that what we have is worth holding onto.

you’ve become someone really special to me. i appreciate the way you care and how you bring comfort just by being there. even after a bad day, you make things feel better.<br><br>

here’s to us, to everything we’ve learned, and to whatever comes next. i’m really happy it’s you.</h1>
