            i want a future with you. i want us to be together through everything.
            a future where we support each other, grow together,
            and face whatever life throws at us side by side. it doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, 
            but it has to be us.<br><br>
            
            i want it to be you, the one i share my dreams with and the one i can count on no matter what.
